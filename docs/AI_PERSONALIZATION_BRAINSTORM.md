# AI-Powered Personalized Aphasia Treatment
## Brainstorming Session Document

**Date:** December 28, 2025
**Facilitator:** Carson (BMAD Brainstorming Coach)
**Participant:** Fred Weiner
**Session Focus:** Using AI to create deeply personalized aphasia treatment using the patient's own people, places, and objects as stimuli

---

## Executive Summary

This brainstorming session explored how AI can transform aphasia therapy from generic exercises into deeply meaningful, personalized practice using the patient's own life - their family members, friends, household objects, and personal stories. The result is a comprehensive vision for an adaptive, emotionally resonant therapy system.

**Core Insight:** Personalization doesn't mean adaptive difficulty alone - it means therapy built around the patient's ACTUAL world: their spouse Barbara, their grandson Timmy, their lake house, their inside jokes and family lore.

---

## Phase 1: Inner Child Conference

### Technique Purpose
Channel pure childhood curiosity to uncover unfiltered insights about what truly matters.

### Key Question
*"If you were 7 years old designing this app for someone you love who has aphasia, what would you think is obvious?"*

### Breakthrough Insights

#### 1. The Computer Should Just KNOW
A child assumes the app already has a complete life map - friends, family, job, hobbies, favorite places. No complex setup required.

**Design Implication:** Create a "Life Story Mode" where caregivers build the patient's world through simple photo uploads and relationship tagging.

#### 2. Predictive Understanding
A child expects: *"Every morning, Dad asks for coffee. It's 7am. He's pointing at the kitchen. Offer: 'Do you want coffee?'"*

**Design Implication:** AI learns patterns and can anticipate/support common daily communication needs.

#### 3. Therapy Should Feel Like Conversation
Instead of: *"What is this object?"* → [generic apple]

The app should say: *"Good morning, Fred! How's Barbara doing today? Tell me about Timmy - what's he up to?"*

**Design Implication:** Practice is embedded in meaningful conversation about real life, not abstract exercises.

#### 4. Severity-Based Personalization

| Severity | Appropriate Target | Example |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| Severe | Just the name | [Photo of wife] → "Barbara" |
| Moderate | Name + simple descriptor | "Barbara... my wife" |
| Mild | Full family lore/stories | "Barbara makes the best apple pie - she won the county fair three times!" |

**Design Implication:** Same stimuli, different goals based on ability level.

#### 5. Adaptive AI Engine (Background Metrics)

The AI silently monitors:

| Metric | What It Measures | What It Indicates |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Response Time | Seconds from prompt to first utterance | Longer = more difficulty |
| Speech Clarity | AI speech recognition confidence score | Lower = less clear production |
| Accuracy | Did they say the target correctly? | Tracks progress |
| Cue Dependency | How many cues needed? | More cues = harder task |

**Automatic Difficulty Adjustment:**
- Good day (fast, clear responses) → AI increases challenge
- Tough day (slow, unclear responses) → AI backs off, builds confidence
- The patient never feels like they're "failing"

---

## Phase 2: Role Playing

### Perspective 1: The Caregiver/Spouse

**Challenge:** Caregivers are exhausted. Setup can't be a burden.

**Solutions Identified:**

1. **Bite-Sized Onboarding**
   - Day 1: Just add spouse + 2-3 key people (10 minutes)
   - App says: *"Great start! Add more anytime."*
   - Grows organically over time

2. **Crowdsourced Family Input**
   - "Invite Family to Help" button
   - Email goes to son Mikey, sister Sue, friend Tom
   - Each person gets simple form:
     - Upload a photo of yourself
     - What does Fred call you? (nickname)
     - What's something Fred would say about you?
     - Share a favorite memory (optional)
   - Submissions auto-import into Fred's therapy world

3. **Benefits:**
   - Barbara isn't alone in setup
   - Richer data (Mikey knows things Barbara might forget)
   - Family feels part of recovery
   - Low burden (2 minutes per person)

### Perspective 2: The Person with Aphasia

**Challenge:** What makes someone WANT to open this app every day?

**Solutions Identified:**

1. **Family News as Motivation**
   ```
   Family posts update → Fred gets notification →
   Fred opens app to SEE the news → App transitions to practice →
   Fred practices names/words related to the news!
   ```

   Example:
   - [Phone buzzes] *"New update from Mikey!"*
   - Fred opens app, sees photo of Mikey at baseball game
   - *"That's Mikey at a baseball game! Can you tell me who this is?"*
   - Practice is natural, motivated by curiosity

2. **Graceful Failure Handling**

   | Situation | App Response |
   |-----------|--------------|
   | Struggling (long pause) | *"Take your time, Fred. No rush."* |
   | Partial attempt | *"Good try! I heard 'Ti-'. Listen: 'Timmy.' Can you try again?"* |
   | Still struggling | *"That's okay! Let's say it together: 'Timmy.'"* |
   | Complete failure | *"Timmy is tricky today. Let's try someone easier..."* |

3. **Core Principle:** No negative reinforcement. Ever.
   - Never say "wrong" or "incorrect"
   - Celebrate every attempt
   - Model correct production
   - Move on gracefully without shame

4. **Practice Reminders**
   - Daily text/email (configurable)
   - Lead with family news, not "time to practice"
   - Example: *"Good morning, Fred! Ready to see what the family's been up to?"*
   - Celebrate streaks: *"4 days in a row! Keep it going?"*
   - Never naggy, always pausable

### Perspective 3: The SLP Clinician

**Challenge:** How does this complement professional therapy?

**Solutions Identified:**

1. **View-Only Access (with patient/family consent)**
   - SLP can see performance data
   - Cannot override AI difficulty settings
   - AI shows rationale for its decisions

2. **SLP Dashboard Shows:**
   ```
   FRED'S PROGRESS REPORT - Last 7 days

   Sessions: 5 | Avg Duration: 12 min
   Stimuli Attempted: 47 | Accuracy: 72%

   METRICS TREND:
   Response Time: 4.2s → 3.8s (improving)
   Speech Clarity: 68% → 71% (improving)
   Cues Required: 2.1 → 1.8 avg (improving)

   AI DIFFICULTY DECISIONS:
   • Increased complexity Day 3 (metrics strong)
   • Backed off Day 5 (clarity dropped - fatigue?)

   TOP PERFORMERS:        NEEDS WORK:
   • Barbara (100%)       • Timmy (45%)
   • Mikey (89%)          • Lake house (52%)
   ```

3. **SLP Role = Consultant, Not Operator**
   - Reviews data to inform in-person sessions
   - *"I see Timmy is hard - let's work on that together"*
   - Validates home practice
   - Provides objective data for documentation
   - Trusts the data-driven system

4. **Rationale for No SLP Override:**
   - AI sees every session; SLP sees patient weekly
   - Data-driven decisions > intuition
   - Avoids conflicts (SLP sets "harder," patient struggles all week)
   - Keeps system simple for families

### Perspective 4: The AI System

**Challenge:** What rules must the AI follow?

**Solutions Identified:**

#### Minimum Viable Start
- 2 people
- A few household items
- That's IT - can start in 10 minutes

#### Continuous Learning
- Weekly email to family requesting updates
- Invite new family members over time
- App grows richer organically

#### Success Indicators
| Metric | Good Sign |
|--------|-----------|
| Correct responses | Increasing |
| Response time | Decreasing |
| Cues required | Fewer needed |
| App opens | Person keeps coming back |

#### The "Hurt" Detector
*"If you were hurting them, they would stop participating."*

Track:
- Sessions per week declining?
- Session duration getting shorter?
- App not opened in X days?

→ Alert caregiver: *"Fred hasn't practiced in 5 days. Everything okay?"*

#### THE AI'S "NEVER DO" LIST

| # | NEVER... | Why |
|---|----------|-----|
| 1 | Negatively reinforce | Destroys confidence |
| 2 | Go too fast | Overwhelms, frustrates |
| 3 | Say "wrong" | Use "Let's try again" |
| 4 | Rush past struggle | Patience IS therapy |
| 5 | Make them feel tested | It's practice, not evaluation |

## Phase 3: Nature's Solutions (Biomimetic)

### Model Selected: The Wolf Pack

Wolves communicate without words through constant observation and adaptation. The AI does the same.

### The Four "Body Language" Signals

| Signal | What Wolf Reads | What AI Reads |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Energy/Alertness | Pack member tired? Lagging? | **Response Time** |
| Strength | Can this one handle the hunt? | **Clarity** |
| Success | Catching prey? | **% Correct** |
| Engagement | Showing up? Part of pack? | **Participation Frequency** |

### Pack Leader (AI) Behavior

| Observation | AI Response |
|-------------|-------------|
| Response time ↑, Clarity ↓ | Ease difficulty, more cues, shorter session |
| Response time ↓, Clarity ↑ | Increase challenge, fewer cues |
| Correct % dropping | Back off, revisit easier targets |
| Participation ↓ | Alert caregiver, send motivating reminder |

### Pack Memory (Longitudinal Learning)

The AI remembers THIS patient's patterns:
- *"Fred struggles with 'Timmy' - maybe shelf it for now"*
- *"Fred always does well with 'Barbara' - use her for confidence building"*
- *"Mondays Fred is slower - don't push hard on Mondays"*

### Critical Rule: No Cross-Patient Learning

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|-------|---------|
| Remember Fred's patterns | Apply Fred's patterns to others |
| Learn Fred struggles with "Timmy" | Assume everyone struggles with grandkids |
| Know Fred is slower on Mondays | Assume all patients are slower on Mondays |
| Track Fred's personal trajectory | Compare Fred to other users |

**Every patient is unique. Every brain injury is different. No assumptions. No stereotypes. No data leakage.**
